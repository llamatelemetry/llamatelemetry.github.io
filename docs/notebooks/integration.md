# Integration Track (Notebooks 05-06)

Focus: fine-tuning/export integration and split-GPU graph workflows.

## Notebook 05: Unsloth Integration

- Objective: bridge training artifacts to GGUF deployment.
- Topics: LoRA adapters, export utilities, deployment handoff.

## Notebook 06: Split-GPU Graphistry

- Objective: run inference and graph analytics in coordinated GPU contexts.
- Topics: Graphistry registration, RAPIDS-backed dataframes/graphs.

## Outcome

- You can take an adapted model into production-style inference.
- You can add graph analysis to inference pipelines without collapsing GPU resources.
