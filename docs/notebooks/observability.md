# Observability Track (Notebooks 14-16)

Focus: production-grade tracing, real-time metrics, and unified observability dashboards.

## Notebook 14: OpenTelemetry LLM Observability

- Introduces SDK-level tracing/metrics setup.
- Covers OTLP export patterns and span enrichment.

## Notebook 15: Real-Time Performance Monitoring

- Demonstrates near-real-time dashboarding.

## Notebook 16: Production Observability Stack

- Combines traces + metrics + visualization layers.
- Integrates graph and numeric telemetry views for operations workflows.

## Recommended prerequisites

- Complete at least notebooks 01-03 first.
- Ensure runtime has telemetry dependencies installed.
