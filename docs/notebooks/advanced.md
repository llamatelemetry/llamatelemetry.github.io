# Advanced Track (Notebooks 07-13)

Focus: knowledge extraction, document graph analysis, large-model strategy, and model internals visualization.

## Knowledge and graph workflows

- Notebook 07: Knowledge graph extraction
- Notebook 08: Document network analysis

## Scale and production workflow

- Notebook 09: Large models on Kaggle
- Notebook 10: Complete workflow

## Model internals visualization

- Notebook 11: Neural network graph views
- Notebook 12: Attention mechanism exploration
- Notebook 13: Token embedding visualization

## Outcome

- You can design end-to-end pipelines beyond single prompt-response flows.
- You can inspect and visualize internals for explainability/debugging.
